Email & SMS verification for all forms (Woocommerce, Contact Form 7 etc). SMS Notification for WooCommerce. Enterprise grade. Active Support. 

== Description ==
= SMS & EMAIL VERIFICATION =
OTP Verification verifies Email Address/Mobile Number of users by sending verification code(OTP) during registration. It removes the possibility of a user registering with fake Email Address/Mobile Number. This plugin checks the existence of the Email Address/Mobile Number and the ability of a user to access that Email Address/Mobile Number. The plugin ships with 10 free email and 10 free SMS transactions.

If you are looking for OTP Verification/Authentication of users during <b>Login</b> then we have a seperate plugin for this. <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/miniorange-2-factor-authentication/"> Click Here </a> to learn more.

= WOOCOMMERCE SMS NOTIFICATION =
This is a separate add-on to the existing plugin which allows your site to send order and WooCommerce notifications to buyers, sellers and admins. Buyer and seller both can get SMS notification after an order is placed or when the order status changes. SMS notification options can be customized in the admin panel very easily. Contact us at info@miniorange.com to know more.
